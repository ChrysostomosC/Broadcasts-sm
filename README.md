# Broadcasts-sm
In this project, i built a web application that allows users to post “broadcasts” (short messages with optional images), follow/unfollow other users, like broadcasts. Search for and view other users’ profiles and showcasing the most popular content. Also created a smart recommendation system to suggest new people to follow. We used ASP.NET Core with Entity Framework Core (EF Core) for data access, Identity for user management, and Git/GitHub for version control.<hr />

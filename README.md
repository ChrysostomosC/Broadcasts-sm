# Broadcasts-sm
In this project, we built a web application that allows users to post “broadcasts” (short messages with optional images), follow other users, like broadcasts, and search for and view other users’ profiles. We used ASP.NET Core with Entity Framework Core (EF Core) for data access, Identity for user management, and Git/GitHub for version control.
